# Personal Landing Page

## Description

As a newly minted web developer I need a page to share my projects and contact info with potential employers or clients. This page serves as my first published web page so that people can learn more about me and my work. The process of building my first web page from scratch taught me a lot about how to effectively use HTML and CSS to creat a well designed page that functions and looks good for multiple devices. In particular, experimenting with the different characteristics and qualities of Flexbox helped me understand the structure of a web page and how to align everything how I want it. I also learned a lot about just how customizable a page can be for different devices with media queries and how they can really help preserve flow across devices so the web page retains its character. It was very satisfying to go from a simple drawn mock up (included below!) to the finished product.
